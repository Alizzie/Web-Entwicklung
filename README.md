<h2>Technologies used</h2>

- REST API: The site uses a RESTful API to communicate between the client-side and server-side, enabling dynamic data exchange.
- SQLite: SQLite is used because of its relational approach.
- Node.js: The server-side logic is powered by Node.js, promoting an asynchronous, event-driven architecture that enhances the site's scalability and performance.
- JavaScript: The entire site is dynamically generated using JavaScript.
