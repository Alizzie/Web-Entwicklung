**Event Management Website**
This project was created for a bachelor course at the Fachhochschule Trier. 

**Key features**
User account creation: Allows users to register and manage their profiles.
Guest list management: Allows users to easily add, edit or remove guests from their events.
Seating Arrangement: Provides seating chart design tools for better event planning.

**Technologies used**
REST API: The site uses a RESTful API to communicate between the client-side and server-side, enabling dynamic data exchange.
SQLite: SQLite is used because of its relational approach.
Node.js: The server-side logic is powered by Node.js, promoting an asynchronous, event-driven architecture that enhances the site's scalability and performance.
JavaScript: The entire site is dynamically generated using JavaScript.
